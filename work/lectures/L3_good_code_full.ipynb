    "We mostly follow the PEP8 style guide (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and PEP20 The Zen of Python (https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/).\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals, wich is a collection of design documents \"providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment\" (from [PEP1: PEP Purpose and Guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/))\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP20 The Zen of Python is a nice summary of the most important code style principles, here are the most important bullet points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "- Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "- Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "- Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "- Readability counts.\n",
    "    - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "        - Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "- Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP8 was written with the intention of making code easier to read and understand by other people as that is an activity that happens a lot more often than writing the code. Some rules may be seen as a little strict (such as line length), but make sense within the context of making code readable. In addition, when everyone adheres (roughly) to the same code style standards we can avoid tracking trivial changes (like number of spaces used for indendation or line breaks) in our repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Spaces are preferred over tabs, but you can most likely configure your IDE to automatically replace tabs with a designated number of spaces. "
