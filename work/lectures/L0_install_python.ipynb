    "Conda is an open-source package and environment management system. Very high-level Python packages (for example Geopandas) have very specific dependency requirements that often clash with the dependency requirements of other high-level packages. If we in one project rely on one package that requires Numpy version > 1.22, and in another project on a package that requires Numpy <= 1.21.5 we have a problem. Conda allows us to set up and quickly switch between fully independent environments that can run completely different versions of packages.\n",
