    "Every programmer encounters errors, both those who are just beginning, and those who have been programming for years. Encountering errors and exceptions can be very frustrating at times, and can make coding feel like a hopeless endeavour. However, understanding what the different types of errors are and when you are likely to encounter them can help a lot. Once you know why you get certain types of errors, they become much easier to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors and exceptions are generally reported on in the form of a *stack trace*, or *traceback* it is called in Python. Let’s examine one:"

    "This particular traceback has two levels. You can determine the number of levels by looking for the number of arrows on the left hand side. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first shows code from the cell above, with an arrow pointing to Line 11 (which is `favorite_ice_cream()`).\n",
    "- The second shows some code in the function `favorite_ice_cream`, with an arrow pointing to Line 9 (which is `print(ice_creams[3])`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last level is the actual place where the error occurred. The other level(s) show what function the program executed to get to the next level down. So, in this case, the program first performed a function call to the function favorite_ice_cream. Inside this function, the program encountered an error on Line 6, when it tried to run the code `print(ice_creams[3]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long tracebacks** Sometimes, you might see a traceback that is very long – sometimes they might even be 20 levels deep! This can make it seem like something horrible happened, but the length of the error message does not reflect severity, rather, it indicates that your program called many functions before it encountered the error. Most of the time, the actual place where the error occurred is at the bottom-most level, so you can skip down the traceback to the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what error did the program actually encounter? In the last line of the traceback, Python helpfully tells us the category or type of error (in this case, it is an `IndexError`) and a more detailed error message (in this case, it says “list index out of range”). We created a list with three elements, so the maximum index in that list is 2, while we tried to access an element at index 3, which doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error and don’t know what it means, it is still important to read the traceback closely. That way, if you fix the error, but encounter a new one, you can tell that the error changed. Additionally, sometimes knowing where the error occurred is enough to fix it, even if you don’t entirely understand the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do encounter an error you don’t recognize, the easiest solution is to take the last line from the traceback (i.e. the actual error message) and search for it online. Often you will find results on Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) at the top, and the answers here are high quality 99% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error or Exception?** There is actually only one true error type in Python, a syntax error. An error indicates a critical problem and cannot be handled and prevents code execution, while exceptions are problems based on syntactically correct code that occur *at runtime* (i.e. during execution). Exceptions generally interrupt program execution, but can be *handled* to avoid this. Regardless, the name `Error` is used to indicate most exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Error\n",
    "\n",
    "When you forget a colon at the end of a line, accidentally add one space too many when indenting under an if statement, or forget a parenthesis, you will encounter a syntax error. This means that Python couldn’t figure out how to read your program. This is similar to forgetting punctuation in English: The panda eats shoots and leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "People can typically figure out what is meant by text with no punctuation, but people are much smarter than computers. If Python doesn’t know how to read the program, it will give up and inform you with an error. For example:"

The correct path would be `writing/myfile.txt`. It is also possible that the file name or its path contains a typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common scenario is that your project uses a file that is not part of your repository such that you need to supply the full file path, which will include device specific directories. For example, I may need to use a file `/home/alexandra/data/mydata.csv` (or `C:\\Users\\alexandra\\data\\mydata.csv` on Windows). If I push this personal file path to the repo, it will cause a `FileNotFoundError` for everyone else in your team. And they might push the \"fixed\" file path, which will cause the same error for you. \n",

    "\n",
    "An exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. Exceptions are known to non-programmers as instances that do not conform to a general rule.
